The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions.

More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n using `public constant` hash digests:\n ```solidity\n bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n ```\n Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n function call, use {hasRole}:\n ```solidity\n function foo() public {\n     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n to enforce additional security measures for this

@dev Returns the root of a tree reconstructed from `leaves` and sibling nodes in `proof`. The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in memory with a custom hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

functions deal with verification of Merkle Tree proofs. The tree and the proofs can be generated using our https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree[JavaScript library]. You will find a quickstart guide in the readme. WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box. IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions that access memory in an unsafe way. NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires additional logic that is not supported by this library.\",\"errors\":{\"MerkleProofInvalidMultiproof()\":[{\"details\":\"The multiproof provided is not valid.\"}]},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":\"MerkleProof\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/Hashes.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8cbd338f083224b4b6f0ff42cbda641a0a6c31ffcdca197452b97fe4d0918269\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f517dec5ba0c6491395acbf7f1d621f4e89e8f218bf5303c867b1c5ad70c6b11\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWmXHRLEw8W6ckth7NyYTU88YfvuS7xSsfae5ksL8qNUe\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x36a0c409c437a753cac9b92b75f93b0fbe92803bf2c8ff1517e54b247f166134\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0f91ba472de411aa557cdbf6560c40750d87bd11c9060bc04d2ba7119af9d5a6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQjtYo2i7dDvzCEzZ67bDoNSG4RrwMoxPWuqFmX5Xzpuw\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol":{"ERC165":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes4","name":"interfaceId","type":"bytes4"}],"name":"supportsInterface","outputs":[{"internalType":"bool","name":"","type":"bool"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"supportsInterface(bytes4)":"01ffc9a7"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes4\",\"name\":\"interfaceId\",\"type\":\"bytes4\"}],\"name\":\"supportsInterface\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bool\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Implementation of the {IERC165} interface.

Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"title\":\"ERC20Mock\",\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"notice\":\"Mock ERC20 token for testing\",\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/std-presale/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol\":\"ERC20Mock\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x19fdfb0f3b89a230e7dbd1cf416f1a6b531a3ee5db4da483f946320fc74afc0e\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3490d794728f5bfecb46820431adaff71ba374141545ec20b650bb60353fac23\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPsfxjVpMcZbpE7BH93DzTpEaktESigEw4SmDzkXuJ4WR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x86b7b71a6aedefdad89b607378eeab1dcc5389b9ea7d17346d08af01d7190994\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1dc2db8d94a21eac8efe03adf574c419b08536409b416057a2b5b95cb772c43c\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZfqJCKVU1ScuX2A7s8WZdQEaikwJbDH5JBrBdKTUT4Gu\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x74ed01eb66b923d0d0cfe3be84604ac04b76482a55f9dd655e1ef4d367f95bc2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://5282825a626cfe924e504274b864a652b0023591fa66f06a067b25b51ba9b303\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeCfPykghhMc81VJTrHTC7sF6CRvaA1FXVq2pJhwYp1dV\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xd6fa4088198f04eef10c5bce8a2f4d60554b7ec4b987f684393c01bf79b94d9f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f95ee0bbd4dd3ac730d066ba3e785ded4565e890dbec2fa7d3b9fe3bad9d0d6e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmSLr6bHkPFWT7ntj34jmwfyskpwo97T9jZUrk5sz3sdtR\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"contracts/std-presale/mocks/ERC20Mock.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x60c5b3d02662f803d1ea2c76462951048b08cc210479c64e81d11cbb0b2d9c18\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://1d416297ef2096ccb77d2bb69ce710c89d7f06ad85e308c75e5a91efc8cd5178\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmV7DsvP1EVZ815bsVCM317bwixQvJGy9Sa1rBMm6pEN9Q\"]}},\"version\":1}"}}}}}
